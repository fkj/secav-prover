section \<open>Completeness of the prover\<close>

text \<open>We start out by specializing the abstract completeness theorem to our prover\<close>
theorem epath_prover_completeness:
  assumes "p \<in> (UNIV :: fm set)"
  defines \<open>t \<equiv> secavProver [p]\<close>
  shows
  "(fst (fst (root t)) = [p] \<and> wf t \<and> tfinite t) \<or>
   (\<exists> steps. fst (fst (shd steps)) = [p] \<and> epath steps \<and> Saturated steps)" (is "?A \<or> ?B")
proof -
  { assume "\<not> ?A"
    with assms have "\<not> tfinite (mkTree fenum ([p], PBasic))"
      unfolding secavProver_def using wf_mkTree fair_fenum by simp
    then obtain steps where "ipath (mkTree fenum ([p], PBasic)) steps" using Konig by blast
    with assms have "fst (fst (shd steps)) = [p] \<and> epath steps \<and> Saturated steps"
      by (metis UNIV_I fair_fenum ipath.cases ipath_mkTree_Saturated mkTree.simps(1) prod.sel(1) wf_ipath_epath wf_mkTree)
    hence ?B by blast
  }
  thus ?thesis by blast

text \<open>We need some lemmas to prove our main theorem\<close>
lemma epath_countermodel:
  assumes \<open>\<exists> steps. fst (fst (shd steps)) = [p] \<and> epath steps \<and> Saturated steps\<close>
  shows \<open>\<exists> e f g . \<not> (semantics e f g p)\<close>
  sorry

lemma epath_lem:
  assumes \<open>p \<in> (UNIV :: fm set)\<close> \<open>\<nexists> steps. fst (fst (shd steps)) = [p] \<and> epath steps \<and> Saturated steps\<close>
  defines \<open>t \<equiv> secavProver [p]\<close>
  shows \<open>fst (fst (root t)) = [p] \<and> wf t \<and> tfinite t\<close>
  using assms(2) epath_prover_completeness t_def by blast

lemma epath_contr:
  assumes \<open>\<tturnstile> [p]\<close>
  shows \<open>\<nexists> steps. fst (fst (shd steps)) = [p] \<and> epath steps \<and> Saturated steps\<close>
proof (rule ccontr, simp)
  show \<open>\<exists> steps. epath steps \<and> fst (fst (shd steps)) = [p] \<and> Saturated steps \<Longrightarrow> False\<close>
  proof -
    assume ep: \<open>\<exists> steps. epath steps \<and> fst (fst (shd steps)) = [p] \<and> Saturated steps\<close>
    have \<open>\<exists> e f g . \<not> (semantics e f g p)\<close>
      using ep epath_countermodel by blast
    with assms show False using sound by fastforce

text \<open>Finally, we arrive at the main theorem\<close>
theorem completeness:
  assumes \<open>\<tturnstile> [p]\<close>
  defines \<open>t \<equiv> secavProver [p]\<close>
  shows \<open>fst (fst (root t)) = [p] \<and> wf t \<and> tfinite t\<close>
  by (simp add: assms epath_contr epath_lem epath_prover_completeness)
